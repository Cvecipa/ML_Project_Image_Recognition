# ML_Project_Image_Recognition
Image Recognition for cracks in walls and pavements - aiming to automate the process of checking structural stability.
## Project Introduction
The following project aims to create and train a machine learning (henceforth ML) model able to classify an image into one of two categories, either cracked or not. 

As such a relevant dataset was selected containing images of walls being both cracked and not (consisting of over 18,000 images) which will be used to teach, train and evaluate the model. 

Throughout the course of this project both CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) and the ML Pipeline will govern the steps and process plan undertaken as seen below.

# How to use the repo
Please refer first to the requirements file (requirements.txt) for version control and then similarly to the instructions file (instructionsforuse.txt) on how to set up and emulate this project.

# Dataset Used + Data Info
As mentioned this project aims to create a model able to identify cracks in walls and pavement accurately to be used as an aid or potentially replace a manual check. In light of this the dataset aquired contains images of various walls/pavement with and without cracks and consists of x images.
